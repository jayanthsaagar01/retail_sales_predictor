# Preparing the Retail Forecaster App for Presentation

Follow these steps to prepare the project for presentation by removing Replit-specific references and files.

## Replace Configuration Files

These files are specific to the development environment and need to be replaced for local deployment:

1. Replace `.replit` with `config.toml`
2. Replace `replit.nix` with `environment.nix`
3. Remove `.config/` directory
4. Remove any files with a `.replit` extension
5. Remove the `generated-icon.png` (automatically generated)

### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
# Replacement method 1: Keep new files and remove old ones
# If you already have the new config.toml and environment.nix files:
rm -f .replit replit.nix generated-icon.png
rm -rf .config
rm -f *.replit

# Replacement method 2: Rename the files
# If you want to keep the configuration but rename it:
mv .replit config.toml
mv replit.nix environment.nix
rm -rf .config
rm -f *.replit
rm -f generated-icon.png
```

### On Windows:
```powershell
# Replacement method 1: Keep new files and remove old ones
# If you already have the new config.toml and environment.nix files:
Remove-Item -Path .replit, replit.nix, generated-icon.png -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path .config -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path *.replit -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Replacement method 2: Rename the files
# If you want to keep the configuration but rename it:
Rename-Item -Path .replit -NewName config.toml -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Rename-Item -Path replit.nix -NewName environment.nix -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path .config -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path *.replit -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path generated-icon.png -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Changing Application Name

You may want to update references to the application name throughout the project. Here are the key places to make these changes:

1. In `app.py`:
   - Update the title and headers
   - Modify any references to Replit in page titles or descriptions

2. In `.streamlit/config.toml`:
   - Update the application title and theme

3. In documentation files:
   - Update `project_explanation.ipynb`
   - Update `mac_setup.md` and `windows_setup.md`

## Current Application Name

The application has been renamed to "Retail Forecaster" as requested.
