# Preparing the Sales Prediction App for Presentation

Follow these steps to prepare the project for presentation by removing Replit-specific references and files.

## Files to Remove

These files are specific to the Replit environment and aren't needed for local deployment:

1. `.replit`
2. `replit.nix`
3. `.config/` directory
4. Any files with a `.replit` extension
5. The `generated-icon.png` (Replit-generated)

You can remove them with these commands:

### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
# Remove Replit-specific files
rm -f .replit replit.nix generated-icon.png
rm -rf .config
rm -f *.replit
```

### On Windows:
```powershell
# Remove Replit-specific files
Remove-Item -Path .replit, replit.nix, generated-icon.png -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path .config -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path *.replit -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Changing Application Name

You may want to update references to the application name throughout the project. Here are the key places to make these changes:

1. In `app.py`:
   - Update the title and headers
   - Modify any references to Replit in page titles or descriptions

2. In `.streamlit/config.toml`:
   - Update the application title and theme

3. In documentation files:
   - Update `project_explanation.ipynb`
   - Update `mac_setup.md` and `windows_setup.md`

## Application Name Suggestions

Consider using one of these names instead of any Replit references:

- RetailPro Forecaster
